# projects
Hi. Thanks for viewing my repository. 

The projects repository contains some of the classes and algorithms I have developed over my last few years in college.  I have worked on several assignments and projects which I have added to this repository to demonstrate my understanding of writing good software especially through an object-oriented programming approach. 

I implemented six popular data structures namely binary search tree, hash table, heaps, linked list, stacks, and queues. Please consult each of the folders of my data structures implementations and review my approach. 

I have implemented five popular sorting algorithms such as insertion sort, merge sort, selection sort, bubble sort and quick sort. I have a strong understanding about how this sorting algorithm works and I can write new implementations for it to solve different problems. 

AkintundeMayokunA1Q1.java – This is project that models a library’s operation. I used three different classes such as the library class, book class and main class. In this project, a user can add a book, search for a book using either the title or author name, loan a book and/or return a book. 

AkintundeMayokunA1Q2.java – In this project, I implemented a recursive Sudoku Solver algorithm that solves a sudoku board using recursive backtracking approach. 

AkintundeMayokunA2Q1.java – In this project, I completed a program that calculates the execution of seven popular sorting algorithm and reports the run time and whether the algorithm was sorted. 

AkintundeMayoknA2Q2.java – In this project, I modeled a train with a linked list, where each node in the linked list will represent a car on the train. The program can drop a car at the beginning, end or at any position in the train. The program can pick new cars and show the list of all the cars in the train. 

AkintundeMayokunA3Q1.java – In this project, I wrote an algorithm that attempts to find a path through a Maze using a stack class and queue class for implementation. 

AkintundeMayokunA3Q2.java – In this project, I wrote a dictionary class that was implemented using hash tables (Open addressing and Separate Chaining) or linked list. 

AkintundeMayokunA4Q1.java - The program is used to create an expression tree for either variable or numbers for operators "+", "-", "*" and "^".

AkintundeMayokunA5Q1.java - This program is an algorithm used to simulate a Hospital's Emergency Room. I implemented the algorithm with the help of a heap.

Push Buttons.C – This is a basic C program that is intended to prove to you that I understand how to use the C programming Language. In this short project, I wrote a program that controls the LEDs on an MX7cK board using push button switches. If you plan to run this program, you will be unsuccessful because the header file and other compliable files are kept on my local machine. 

TrashCan Projects.py - This is a basic Python program that is intended to prove to you that I understand how to use the Python programming Language. The purpose of this program which is the best program I wrote in my first year that inspired me to continue studying computer engineering. The purpose of this program is to represent trash cans using two-dimensional array. Each column in the array represents a trash and each cell represent a trash. Each trash can hold the same number of bags. When one trash can is filled, the trash displays a message to the user to go and pick up the trash as soon as possible. 
I hope you are now convinced that I am brilliant programmer that can bring value to your company and the world if you invest in me. 

Kind regards,
